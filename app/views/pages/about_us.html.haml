      %p Cheko started in 2018 when a college student wanted to use technology to improve students’ lives. Now, our goal is to craft products built around the everyday problems of students. Ultimately, the products should help students save time and graduate.
      %p We currently have three services. The first one is Cheko homework help. When you need homework help, we will connect you to a creator that is an expert in the subject. We work with over 100 creators that we have interviewed, vetted, and tested, and built this expert team throughout the years. We also have content reviewers that ensure the overall quality of each task according to your requirements.
      %p The second is Cheko Profstopick. We know that some of you want to pick the perfect professor for your class. Thus, we created Profstopick, a database that contains comments and ratings on various professors collected from the students themselves. Profstopick allows you to see overall reviews of professors with metrics specific to different universities. Our team constantly updates the database to provide relevant information.
      %p Our third service is the Cheko Study Resource Database. It contains thousands of test questions, past papers, study guides, and other learning resources from various students. Students can access study resources at any time. The Cheko team constantly monitors the database and categorizes each material based on their subject matters, the school they were from, and the year they were available. We review the materials we receive to ensure that each is correct and relevant to your needs.
      %p We plan to continue building the business around the customer. We will use any tool – be it AI, IT, or even venture into the Metaverse – just to better converse with you. Ultimately, we want to solve every one of your study problems. That is what Cheko is here for.
