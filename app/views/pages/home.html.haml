      %h2 About Cheko 
      %p Cheko started in 2019 when a college student wanted to improve students’ lives. Now, our goal is to craft tools and services built around the everyday problems of students. Ultimately, we should help students save time and graduate. Currently, we have four services to do that.

      %p 
        The first one is 
        %strong HW-Help. 
        When you need help with homework, we will connect you to a tutor that is an expert in the subject. We work with over 300 tutors that we have interviewed, vetted, and tested, and built this expert team throughout the years.

      %p 
        The second is 
        %strong Profs to Pick. 
        It is a professor-rating and review system that contains comments and ratings on various professors collected from the students themselves. To create this tool, we turn qualitative data into quantitative data so that at one look, you can see how easy, strict, and effective the prof is. We also have metrics specific to students, no complicated words. Students can help refine the ratings by adding a prof review too!

      %p 
        The third is 
        %strong Q&A. 
        This is a question and answer section where you can talk directly to one of our tutors. It is built for quick answers to quick questions. Snap a photo and get an answer!

      %p
        The fourth is 
        %strong Cheko AI. 
        This is our latest venture in using AI to help you solve your writing problems. Just ask Cheko AI a question, and it will answer it! It is best to use this as an AI-writing academic assistant. 

      %p We plan to continue building the company around you. We will use any tool – be it AI, IT, or even venture into the Metaverse – just to better interact with you. Ultimately, we want to solve every one of your problems. That is what Cheko is here for.
